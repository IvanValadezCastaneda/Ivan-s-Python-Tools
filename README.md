This is a Set of Python Tools that I developed (with more to come) some of them for fun and others for work use.

Feel free to use them as you wish or to modify them.
1. Automatic Raffle Maker.
  The purpose of it is to make Raffles in an automatic and random manner without repetition and for many participants as you want
  In order to use it you must run the Script using Python and the name of the Script.
  It will be for 6 participants and 6 options to pair them against and it will output an array randomizing each participant an option to make a raffle.
  If you want to modify it just modify the number of entries or the number to compare against

3. UTF8 Checker
  The purpose of this Script is to check in a series of .csv files in a given directory for if any of those files include characters reserved for the Latin UTF8 
  this means:"á", "é", "í", "ó", "ú" if by any third party script the inclusion of these characters may cause an error with this script you can sort the one that is causing
  those issues easily the script will output the name of the file and the character included so the user doesn't have to go one by one and check for each character
  just remember to include the script itself inside the desired directory that you want to be checked for these characters
